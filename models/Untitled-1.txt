      "crop": "URAD (उड़द)",
      "details": "Urad or urad is a major pulses crop. Urad cultivation has been in place since ancient times. Urad crop is prepared by ripening in a short period of time. Its crop is suitable for kharif, rabi and summer seasons. Urad is mainly used as a pulse in our country. By cultivating urad with short duration (60-65 days) pulses crop in irrigated area of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, there is an expected increase in annual income of farmers. Also soil conservation / fertility can also be promoted.Advanced species: -Mainly two types of species are found, first for production in Kharif such as - Shekhar-3, Azad Urd-3, Pant Urd-31, WV-108, Pant U.-30, I.P. U-94 and PDU-1 are mainly for production in Zayed, Pant U-19, Pant U-35, Type-9, Narendra Urd-1, Azad Urd-1, Uttara, Azad Urd-2 and Shekhar-2 are species. There are some species that produce both kharif and zayed, such as type-9, Narendra Urd-1, Azad Urd-2, Shekhar Urd-2, these species can be grown in both crops.Seed rate: -Average 8–10 kg per acre.Sowing Time: -The appropriate time for sowing urad in the Kharif season is the second fortnight of June (June 15 to June 30). Late sowing should be avoided.Seed treatment: - Before urad ki bubai, treat the seeds with a value of 3 grams of thyram or 2.5 grams of dietary M-45 per kg of seeds. Trichoderma mold destroyer is used at the rate of 5 to 6 grams per kg of seed for organic seed treatment.Land  : -Urad is cultivated in a wide variety of lands. Light sandy, loam or medium type of land with good water drainage is more suitable for Urad. The land between Ph. Mann 7-8 is fertile for Urad. Acidic and alkaline soil is not suitable.Preparation of field: -For the cultivation of urad, plow the field well 2-3 times before sowing with a native plow or cultivator, so that the soil becomes brittle and after that, prepare a field for sowing by running the pata.Climate :-The moist and warm weather is necessary for the cultivation of urad. 25–35 ° C temperature is appropriate at the time of growth. Urad is easily grown in areas with 700–900 mm rainfall. It is not suitable for cultivation in high waterlogged areas. Excess rainfall at the flowering stage is harmful. The grain gets spoiled when it rains at ripening stage.Chemical fertilizers and fertilizers: -While preparing the field in Urad crop, 15-20 tons of good rotten cow dung manure per acre should be mixed well in the soil. Apply chemical fertilizers basically before sowing. Rainfall condition: 12.5 kg nitrogen + 25 kg phosphorus + 12.5 kg potassium oxide + 10 kg sulfur / acre. Other nutrients should be used on the basis of soil testing.Harmful pests and diseases and their prevention: -Pod borer: The insects of this insect pierce the beans and eat the grains. Due to which there is a huge loss of yield.Prevention: Make a solution of one liter per hectare of monocrotophos in 500 liters of water and sprinkle it. White fly:   It is the main pest of urad crop. Which acts as a carrier of the yellow mosaic virus.Prevention: Triasjophos 40 E.C. Sprinkle one liter of water in 500 liters of water. Add 100 ml of acetamoprid or imidacloprid or 25 liters of 51 imethoate in 500 liters of water and sprinkle at the rate of one hectare.Ardha Kundalak (Semi Lupar) - It sieves the leaves mainly by eating soft leaves. Prevention - Qinalphas or Profenophos 50 E.C. Make a sprinkle of 1 liter solution in 500 liters of water. Aphid - It suck the juice of mulankur. Due to which the growth of plants is stopped. Prevention - Profeno + Cyper 1 liter or Chlorpyriphos 20 E.C. Sprinkle should be mixed with 1 liter of 600 liters of water solution.Yellow Mosaic Virus - This is a common Urad disease and is spread by the virus. Its effect starts to appear only after 4-5 weeks. In this disease, yellow spots appear first on the leaves in a circular form. The entire leaves turn yellow in a few days. Finally, these leaves turn white and dry.Prevention - Disease control is possible with the prevention of white fly. Sowing of Urad Yellow Mosaic Disease resistant variety Pant U-19, Pant U-30, UG.218, TPU-4, Pant Urad-30, Barkha, KU-96-3 needed.Leaf Moderate Diseases - New leaves appear on the middle vein of the leaf in the form of glandularity . In this disease, the leaves turn upwards of the middle veins and the lower leaves turn inwards and the growth of leaves stops and the plants die.Prevention - It is a viral disease. Which is transmitted by thrips. 75% SP for acetate for thrips Or sprinkle 2 ml of dimethoate per liter and sowing the crop on time.Leaf spot disease - This disease is spread by fungi. Its symptoms appear as small spots on the leaves. Prevention - Carbendazim + Mancozeb 1 kg should be mixed and sprayed in 1000 liters of water solution.weed control :-Weeds cause more damage than crop estimates. Therefore, in order to produce more time, proper modern sleepers should be used properly while running the time-wise bidding kulpa and dora etc. Weeds can be controlled by spraying pendimethaline 1.25 kg in 1000 liters of water after sowing the crop but before germination of the seeds.Irrigation: -Usually, the kharif crop does not require irrigation. If there is a lack of rain, then an irrigation must be made at the time of producing beans. Urad crop requires 3 to 4 irrigation in Zayed. First irrigation as palaeva and other irrigation should be done as per the requirement of the crop at an interval of 15 to 20 days. It is very important to have proper moisture in the field at the time of flowering and formation of grains.Harvesting Time: -When the pods and plants dry up, the grains become hard, and the grain moisture content at the time of harvesting should be 22.5%. Splitting pods (spreading crop seeds as they mature) is a common problem in lentils. Therefore, the pod should be lifted as it matures. The harvested crop should be picked up after 2-3 days.Storage: -After harvesting, the plant is spread on the floor to dry. Keep the cut stems in the sun to dry. To get the right type of variety, keep the harvested crop separate from one variety. To remove moisture in urad grains, it is necessary to dry thoroughly in the sun. The crop can then be stored. The crop should be stored in a moisture free location.production :-The yield is 10-15 quintal per hectare in pure crop and 6-8 quintal per hectare in mixed crop."

      "crop": "COTTON (कपास)",
      "details": "Cotton farming is one of the most important fiber and cash crops in India. Cotton cultivation is grown almost all over the world. This cotton cultivation provides basic raw material to the textile industry. Cotton farming in India provides livelihood directly to about 6 million farmers and 40 to 5 million people are employed in its trade or processing. Cotton is also a means of earning for many people.Cotton cultivation in our country is also called white gold. There is a need for large scale cotton production in the country. Because the importance of cotton can be applied to these works, it is made of cloth, its oil is extracted and its vinola is widely used in fiberless animal feed.Cotton is classified into three categories: -If seen, cotton with long filament is considered to be the best, whose length is 5 cm, it is included in the items of high quality. Cotton, which is 3.5 to 5 cm in length, is called mixed cotton. The third type of cotton is small filament. The length of which is 3.5 cm.Quantity of seed: -The quantity of seed depends very much on the variety of seeds, the area to be grown, irrigation, etc. For American hybrid cotton, 1.5 - 2 kg per acre, while for American cotton, the amount of seed should be 3.5 - 4 kg per acre. The seed quantity should be 1.25 - 2 kg / acre for indigenous cotton variety and 3 - 4 kg / acre for indigenous cotton variety.Seed treatment: -- Leven in a village Streptosaiklin or two grams Take dried soaked in Agrimaisin slurry 8 to 10 hours of work after seeding in 10 liters of water the seeds to avoid seed-borne diseases.- Where there is an outbreak of root rot disease, treat Trichoderma hargenium or Pseudomonas Fluorescein biofuels at the rate of 10 gm per kg of seed or chemical fungicides such as carboxin 70 W P, 3 g per kg seed or Carbendazim 50 W P to 2 Treat gram or thyram at the rate of 3 grams per kilogram of seeds.To remove the filament in a natural way, soak the seeds overnight in water, then mash the seeds with dung and ash of wood or wood the next day. Then dry the seeds in shade before sowing.- The chemical pattern depends on the fiber of the seed. Mix pure sulfuric acid (Udyog grade) 400 grams per 4 kg seed for American cotton and 300 grams per 3 kg seed for native cotton for 2-3 minutes. This will remove the entire fiber of the seeds. Then pour 10 liters of water in the seeded pot and shake it well and drain the water. Wash the seeds thrice with plain water and then for one minute with lime water (sodium bicarbonate 50 grams per 10 liters of water). Then wash once again and dry in shade.- Do not use metal or wood chemical way pot, but to use the pitcher made of plastic pots or clay. While doing this action, use gloves.- One kilogram fiber seed without fiber can be treated with 5 g imidacloprid 70 W S or 4 g Thiomithoxam 70 W S to reduce harmful insect pests and leaf torsion virus.In unirrigated conditions, sowing the cotton by sowing 10 kg of seed per kg of ejectobacter culture increases the yield. Time of sowing :-The appropriate time for cotton sowing varies from region to region. Sowing of this crop must be done in the months of April and May.Method of planting seeds: -Use a sowing machine for native cotton sowing and dig pits for hybrid or Bt varieties. Square sowing is more profitable than rectangular. Due to non-germination of some seeds and destruction, the gap is increased in many places. It is necessary to eliminate this gap. Destroy the weak, sick and affected plants after two weeks of sowing.Distance: -75x15 cm in irrigated condition for American cotton. And 60x30 cm in a desert position. Keep the distance of For indigenous cotton, keep a distance of 60x30 in irrigated and rainfed condition.Earth :-Balui loam soil and black soil are considered most suitable for cotton cultivation. Cotton is high in this type of soil. But today a variety of hybrid varieties have come on the market. Due to which cotton is being grown easily in hilly and sandy places today. For this, the PH of the land The value should be from 5.5 to 6. Cotton farming requires less water. For this reason, it should be harvested in soil with good drainage.Land Preparation: -After harvesting the rabi crop, a deep plowing should be done with the plow that turns the soil of the field. After this, by running the harrow two or three times, the cultivated soil should be made fine and brittle. In this way, the field is ready for sowing.Temperature :-It is advisable for the crop to grow at least 16 degrees centigrade and the ideal temperature for germination is 32 to 34 degrees centigrade. 21 to 27 degree temperature is required for its growth. The daytime temperature should be 25 to 30 degree centigrade and the nights should be cold at the time of flowering.Rainfall: -Cotton requires at least 75 cm of rainfall. Rainfall of more than 125 cm is harmful.Manures and Fertilizers: -15-20 tonnes of good rotten dung manure per hectare should be mixed well in the land while preparing the field before sowing cotton.American and Bt varieties require 75 kg of nitrogen per hectare and 35 kg of phosphorus and native varieties of 50 kg of nitrogen and 25 kg of phosphorus per hectare.Potash fertilizer should be cultivated on the basis of soil test before planting, full quantity of phosphorus and potash and half the amount of nitrogen. Devise the remaining half of the natrogen at the time of flower buds forming.Hazardous kits and diseases and their prevention: -Harmful pests -Green Mosquito- For its prevention, spray the appropriate amount of imidacloprid 17.8 sL or monocrotophos 36 sl on the plants. Tela - For its prevention, spray the appropriate amount of imidacloprid 17.8 SL or Thiomethaxam 25 WG on plants. Thrips - Methyl demetan 25 EC 160ml for prevention of thrips.

Spray every acre by adding 200 liters of water or 40 grams of thymathoxam in 200 liters of water.Found bug - Quinalphos 25 EC 5 ml for its prevention. Or Chlorpyriphos 20 EC 3 ml Spray per liter of water.Pied Sundi - American Sundi -  Tobacco Sundi - Pink Sundi: - For its prevention, qinalphos 25 EC, 2.0 ml per liter or indoxacarb 14.5 s C, 1.0 ml per liter or spinoside 45 s C, 0.33 ml per liter or flubandiamide 480 s C, spray one insecticide at the rate of 0.40 ml per liter of water.Harmful DiseasesScorching disease - For its prevention, spraying of copper oxychloride should be done on the plant. Plant catarrh disease - To prevent this, antralkal or mencozeb should be sprayed after mixing in 40 g / 15 liters of water. Alternaria leaf spot disease - tabuconazole 1 ml for its prevention. Or spray of triflocetrobin + tabuconazole 0.6 g per liter after 60th, 90th, and 120th day of sowing. If the disease is seen in the field, spray it with copper oxychloride or Captain 500 gm per 200 liters of water, or spray it with Carbendazim 12 per cent + Mancozeb 63 per cent WP 25 gm in 10 liters of water.Root rot disease - It is necessary to treat the seeds for its prevention.weed control :-First self-cultivation should be done by running Kolpa or Dora within 15 to 20 days of germination. Weedicides include pyratobrec sodium (750 g / ha) or fluorchlorine / pendamethalin 1 kg. The active ingredients can be used prior to sowing.Irrigation: -It is necessary to give 3-4 irrigation in cotton crop. First irrigation should be done late. Cotton farming requires very little water. If there is more rain then it does not require initial irrigation. But if the rain is not on time, its first irrigation is needed after about 45 to 50 days. Irrigation of the field must be done while the sycamore and flowers arrive.Cotton Towing: -The first weeding of cotton should be done when the cotton tots bloom 40 to 60 percent. After that do the second plucking after all the tinde blossoms. Cotton picking is completed in 3-4 times.production :-On cultivation with the above advanced method, yields of 20 to 25 of native cotton, 25 to 32 of hybrid cotton and 30 to 50 quintals per hectare of BT cotton can be obtained."

Now, corn has been recognized as corn, pop corn, sweet corn, baby corn, etc. Where is the diversity seen in any other crop? Maize cultivation is prevalent in many countries of the world, including the United States of America according to area and production,Famous varieties: -Hybrid castes - Ganga-1, Ganga-4, Ganga-11, Deccan-107, KH-510, DHM-103, DHM-109, HIM-129, Pusa Early Ha-1 & 2, Vivek Ha-4, DHM- 15 etc.Composite Castes - Narmada Moti, Jawahar Makka-216, Chandan Makka-1, 2 & 3, Chandan White Makka-2, Pusa Composite-1, 2 & 3, Mahi Kanchan, Arun, Kiran, Jawahar Makka - 8, 12 & 216 , Prabhat, Navjot etc.Quantity of seed: -Hybrid species: - 12 to 15 kg / ha.Composite species: - 15 to 20 kg / ha.For green fodder: - 40 to 45 kg / ha.(According to small or big donations too, the amount of seed is less or more.)Maize Sowing Time: -1. Kharif: June to July.2. Rabi: October to November.3. Zayed: February to March.Seed treatment: -Fungicide Seed Treatment- Treat pre-sowing seeds at the rate of 3 grams per kg of thyram or carbendazim seeds, mix them in water and make a wet paste and apply on the seeds.Pesticide Seed Treatment- Seed treatment with pesticide is necessary to protect seeds and new plants from sap and pests living in the soil. Treat the seeds with thiomethochem or imidacloprid at the rate of 1 to 2 grams per kg of seeds.Seed treatment with biological vaccines- After treatment with fungicide and insecticide, sow seeds immediately after treatment with Azotobacter 5 gm per kg of seeds.Method of sowing: -Seeds can be made by digging a pit with hands or by making a raid with the help of tractors and sawdrills in a modern way. Seeds 3-4 cm long Seed deep. Sweet Corn sowing 2.5 cm Do it in depth.Above mentioned land: -Maize can be cultivated in all types of land. But for good growth and productivity of maize, loam and medium to heavy soil having adequate amount of bacteria and proper drainage is suitable. For this, such land where water drainage is good.Preparation of field: -For maize cultivation, plow the field well 2-3 times before sowing with a native plow or cultivator, so that the soil becomes brittle and then after plowing, prepare the field for sowing.Favorable Climate: -Maize is a hot weather plant. The appropriate temperature is 21 ° C for germination and 32 ° C for growth.Manure and Chemical: -While preparing the land for maize cultivation, 5 to 8 tons of well rotten cow dung manure should be added to the field and after ground test, where there is a deficiency of zinc, 25 kg / ha zinc sulphate should be applied before the rain. Add phosphorus 75-150 kg, urea 75-110 kg and potash 15-20 kg per acre. Keep in mind that chemical fertilizers should be used only on soil testing basis.Harmful pests and their prevention: -Stem borer -  carbofuran 3g 20 kg or phorate 10 percent CG 20 kg or dimethoate 30 percent EC 1.0 liter per hectare or qinalphas 25 percent EC 1.50 liter for its prevention.Pink borer - To prevent this, treat carbofuron with 5% w / 2.5g seed per kg of seed. Apart from this, the loss can also be avoided by putting 4 kg of tricycocard per acre after 10 days of  germination. Lights and pheromone cards are also used to catch kites.Corn Warm - For   chemical control, one week before sowing, spread 10 kg of forage and mix 10g in the field.Branch moth - Dimethoate 2 ml to prevent it. Spray in water per liter of water.Termites - In case of an outbreak in standing crops, use chlorpyrifas with irrigation water at the rate of 20% EC 2.5 liters per hectare.Branch fly -   Apply 10% CG @ 5 kg / acre in soil at the time of sowing. Apart from this, dimethoate 30 percent EC 300 ml. Or methyl demetan 25 percent EC 450 milliliters. Spray per acre.Harmful diseases and their prevention: -Melt stem - To prevent this, do not let the water stand and pay attention to drainage. Spraying at the rate of 15 grams of streptocycline or 60 grams of agramycin and 500 grams of copper oxychloride per hectare is more beneficial in case of disease. Or 150 g Captan took 100 l. It should be dissolved in water and poured over the roots.Leaf Scorching Disease - To prevent this, spraying of diathane M-45 or zineb 2.0-2.5 gm / liter of water with 2-4 sprays at 7-10 days distance can be prevented early in the disease.Brown spots under the leaves -  To prevent this, uproot and destroy the affected plants and spray a mixture of Metallaxil 1 gram or Metallaxil + Mancozeb 2.5 grams per liter of water. Tulasita disease- For   the prevention of these, zinc manganese carbamate or jeeram should be sprayed at the rate of 80 per cent, two kilograms or 27 per cent at the rate of three liters per hectare in the required amount of water.weed control :-15-20 days after sowing, do dandai-gudhi by running a dora or use a sedative called atrazine in a chemical sterilizer. For etrazine use, spraying should be done at the rate of 600-800 g / acre before germination. After this, soil should be raised after about 25-30 days.Irrigation: -Maize is mostly grown in areas where the annual rainfall is between 60 cm to 110 cm. Zayed crops require more irrigation. Not irrigating at the right time leads to a huge reduction in yields. First irrigation should be done 15 to 20 days after sowing. After that, when the crop is up to the knees, when the flowers are grown, when they are bhuta and while the grain is being fed, irrigate them. The crop needs 5-6 irrigation.Harvesting and Threshing: -When the leaves covering the corn are yellow or brown and the moisture of the seeds is less than 30 percent, then the crop should be harvested; the plant remains green after cutting the corn, use it for animal feed.The most important function in maize crop after harvesting is threshing, in which the cellar is used to extract the grains. In the event of not having a cellar, corn can be threshed by improving the normal thresher. There is no need to remove the corn peel. When the corn is dry, it can be threshed by putting it in the thresher and there is no erosion of the grain.Storage :-The grains obtained after harvesting and threshing should be dried and stored well under sunlight. If the grains are to be used for seeds, dry them so much that the moisture is about 12 percent. And also store in a moisture free place.  Production Capacity: Yields 10 to 20 quintals per acre. With hybrids we can get yield up to 40 quintals per acre. "

Values 6.5–7.5 are optimal.Land Preparation: -Land preparation has a special importance in the successful production of onions. The first plowing of the field should be done with soil plowing plow, after that do 2 to 3 plowing with cultivator or harrow, after every plowing, apply patta so that the moisture is protected and at the same time the soil becomes brittle.Manures and Fertilizers: -Compost of cow dung or compost is 200 quintal per hectare and nitrogen, phosphorus, potash and sulfur 100, 50, 100, 25 kg per hectare respectively. Dung manure or compost, phosphorus and potash land should be given at the time of preparation and nitrogen divided into three parts after 15 and 45 days of planting. Other general rules for fertilizers and fertilizers should be followed. Keep in mind that essential nutrients should be used only on the basis of soil testing. Harmful pests and diseases and their prevention: -Onion catarrh -  Brown spots on leaves later leaves dry - Spray 0.15% Diethane Z-78 for this.Mriduromil mildew - The leaves first become yellow, green and elongated and circular spots appear on those leaves. Later these leaves begin to turn and dry. To control this, spray 0.35% copper oxychloride mildew.Sore Throat - When its outbreak, the scales start to collapse. To prevent this, protect the crop from insects and moisture.Onion thrips - Its Pillu worms suck the juice by piercing the leaves and roots. As a result, bright streaks are seen on the leaves and the entire crop starts to look white. Prevention: To prevent this, spray insecticides.weed control :-Weeds grown on the crop - Satyanashi (Kateli), Chaulai, Dube, Motha, Makda, Khatuva. Weed-out weeds from the onion crop. Propaquizafop 5% + Oxyflurofen 12% w / w EC can be used as chemical weedicide. Weed does not germinate by spraying pendimethylene 3.5 liters per hectare in 800 liters of water for three days after transplanting. Irrigation: -In Kharif season crop, irrigate immediately after planting otherwise delay in irrigation increases the chances of dying of the plant. Irrigate the onion crop grown during the Kharif season as and when the monsoon goes. Irrigate lightly at intervals of 8-10 days as required. If water stops in the field due to excess rain or other reasons, arrange to remove it soon, otherwise the chances of mildew-related diseases in the crop increases.Digging of onion tubers: -Kharif onion crop is ready for digging in about 5 months in November-December. As soon as the onion knot takes its full size and the leaves start to dry, stop irrigating about 10-15 days in advance and crush the top of the onion plants with the help of feet. This causes the tubers to solidify and stop their growth. After this, the tubers are dug and dried in queues only in the field .Storage: - Onion storage is an important task. Some varieties have high storage capacity, such as Pusa Red, Nashik Red, Bellary Red and N-2-4. The N-53, Earlygreno and Pusa Ratnar have low storage capacity. Varieties in which foods have low refractive index and high evaporation speed and total evaporation have low storage capacity. Smaller tubers have higher storage capacity than larger ones. Moisture-free and ventilated places are suitable for onion storage. And proper temperature is required. The average yield of kharif onion varies from 300-350 q / ha. "

After every fertilizer, cover the crop again with 20 quintals of green leaves per acre.Earth :-Cultivation of Ginger Baluy loam, which has a high amount of fossils or organic matter, is the most suitable land. The soil pH value is 5.6. These 6.5 and good drainage lands are best for higher yield than the best, ginger crop. Do not grow ginger crop in the field where ginger crop was grown last time. Do not plant ginger on the same land every year.Climate :-Ginger can be cultivated well in hot and humid climate. Apart from this, there should be 50 to 60 centimeters of annual rainfall at the time of development of the crop, as well as the land should be such that where the water cannot stay for long and adequate shade also remains. Preparation of field: -For the cultivation of ginger, before plowing the monsoon, the field should be plowed four or five times and the soil should be crushed and leveled. 15 cm for sowing ginger. Make beds high and 1 meter wide. 50 cm between two beds. Keep the distance of There should be a good drainage system.Manures and chemical fertilizers: -Ginger is a long-term crop. Which needs more nutrients. Fertilizers should be used after soil testing. While preparing the field before sowing ginger, it should be well mixed with soil at the rate of 10-15 tonnes of manure / acre of good rotten dung. And in chemical fertilizer use nitrogen 25 kg (55 kg urea), phosphorus 10 kg (60 kg single super phosphate) and potash 10 kg (16 kg muret of potash) per acre. Add full quantity of potash and phosphorus at the time of sowing. Divide the amount of nitrogen into two equal parts. Apply the first part 75 days after sowing and the remaining 3 months after sowing.Harmful pests and diseases and their prevention: -Harmful pestsGinger mite and turmeric tuber flask - Chloropyrifos (5%) dust 25 kg / ha for its prevention. Put in the field at the time of sowing. Niger Shulk - To prevent this, quinalphos should be treated with dust for 20 minutes before sowing and storing them. Thrips - Dimethoate 2 ml / l to prevent this. Sprinkle with water. Stem borer and leaf modulator - Dimethoate 2 ml / l for its prevention. Or Qinalphos 2 ml / l. Sprinkle with water.Harmful diseases: -Mildew - Mancojev 2 for its prevention. Sprinkle per liter of water.Uktha or jaundice and tuberculosis - For its prevention, Mancojev + Metallaxil 3 ml. Dissolve water in per liter or drenching in standing crop by dissolving it in per liter of water.Bacterial stimulation - To prevent this, strepocycline 200 p. PN solution should be treated to the tubers.Anthracnose - Hexaconazole 10 ml for its prevention. Or Mancozeb 75 WP 25 grams per 10 liters of water + 10 ml Spray stickersweed control :-Ginger seedlings germinate in 15 to 25 days, so weeding should be done in the field as needed. Apply soil to the roots for the growth of roots. Apply soil to the roots for the first time after 50-60 days of sowing and then apply soil again after 40 days.Irrigation: -Irrigate ginger crops on the basis of rainfall intensity and recurrence. Irrigation and water management It is very important to maintain equal moisture in the cultivation of ginger. That is why the first irrigation in its cultivation should be done immediately after sowing. If drip irrigation or drip irrigation is used in better irrigation techniques for ginger cultivation, it may yield very good results.Digging: - After eight months of sowing, when the leaves turn yellow and slowly start to dry, the crop is ready for harvesting. The plants are carefully uprooted with the help of a shovel or a hoe to separate the rhizome from the root and soil. To use ginger as a vegetable, it should be dug out and removed in the sixth month itself. The rhizomes should be washed thoroughly and dried in sunlight and used for at least one day.Storage: - To make good seeds, store the rhizome in strongholds built in shady places. When the crop is in the green state of 6-8 months, they select healthy plants in the field. The seeds are dried in a shady place after treating them for 30 minutes in a solution of 0.075% quinulfose and 0.3% mancozeb. Seed rhizomes are conveniently stored by making pits. Dung the walls of these pits with cow dung. In pits, a layer of the process is then placed 2 cm in a layer of sand / sawdust. To get enough air, the pits leave enough space inside. These pits are covered with wooden planks. To make these planets ventilated, make one or two holes in them. The seed rhizome should be observed at an interval of about 21 days and should be removed by destroying the disease or obstructed process."

      "crop": "RICE (चावल)",
      "details": "Paddy is a major crop from which rice is extracted. It is the staple food of many countries of Asia and the world including India. Paddy is the most commonly grown grain in the world after maize. Paddy or rice is the most important food crop of India. Which covers a quarter of the total cropped area. Paddy or rice is the food of about half the Indian population. Rather it is eaten mainly for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural food crop with the third highest worldwide production after sugarcane and maize. Paddy is one of the oldest known crops, it was grown in China in the largest form around 5000 years ago. 3000 AD of paddy in India. Was discovered in This discovery was not made by any scientist but by farmers and native people.Paddy Cultivation Countries Paddy Cultivation Countries and Territories - Paddy is grown successfully in regions with warmer climates. Most of the world's paddy originates in South East Asia. China, Japan, India, Indochina, Korea, Thailand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are the major rice growing countries. Paddy cultivation is also practiced in a wide area in Italy, Egypt and Spain. Paddy is cultivated in almost all the states in India but the major producing states are Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh.Varieties: -There are three thousand varieties of rice in India, of which some varieties of rice are prepared in a short time. Short-duration rice varieties are ready in 60 to 75 days. Among the high yielding rice seeds are IR-5, IR-20, IR-22 and Taichung.Quantity of seed for transplanting method: -Healthy seeds should be trimmed before sowing. For this, 10% salt solution is used. To make a salt solution, dissolve 2.0 kg of normal salt in 20 liters of water and add 30 kg of seeds in this solution and shake it well, this will make healthy and heavy seeds sit down and little and light seeds will float upwards. In this way, clean and healthy pruned 20 kg seed in fine grain varieties and 25 kg seed in varieties of coarse grains is sufficient to prepare a plant for transplanting one hectare.the treatment :- For seed treatment, dissolve 10 gm of bovistine and 2.5 gm of posamycin or 1 gm of streptocycline or 2.5 gm of agramycin in 10 liters of water. Now keep 20 kg of sorted seed in 25 liter above solution for 24 hours. This treatment helps in controlling diseases like root rot, gust and leaf scorching disease.There are mainly 3 ways to grow rice: -- Terai or Paddy Cultivation (mostly commercial rice agricultural land worldwide). Rice is grown on land that is full of rain or irrigation water. Water depths range from 2 to 20 inches (5 to 50 cm).- Floating and deep water rice. Rice is cultivated on land where there is too much water. Water depths exceed 20 inches (50 cm) and can reach up to 200 inches (5 m). Only a few varieties of rice can be grown this way.- Hill rice cultivation (very low percentage of agricultural land of rice in the world). Rice is grown on flood-free land, and the crop is heavily dependent on rainwater. Natural rainfall is the only method of irrigation of these fields. In such a case, we have to keep in mind that there should be continuous rain for 3 to 4 months, which is very important for the correct growth of plants.In general, water protects the rice plants from too much cold and heat. Water also prevents weeds from growing.Suitable Land: -Soils with high water holding capacity such as smooth, matiyar or matiyar-loam soils are often suitable for paddy cultivation. The pH value of the land is 5.5 to 6.5. Although paddy can be cultivated in land with 4 to 8 or even more pH value, the most suitable soil is considered to be of pH 6.5. In alkaline and saline lands, paddy can be successfully grown by using soil reformers properly.H lava age: -Paddy is mainly a crop of warm and subtropical climate. Paddy can be grown successfully in all areas where the average temperature is 21 ° C or more for 4 to 6 months. Temperature is 25 to 30 degrees Celsius for good growth of the crop and 20 to 25 degrees Celsius for ripening. The lower the night temperature, the better it is for crop production. But should not fall below 15 ° C.Field preparation and sowing: -Rice is a growing plant under any circumstances, which can be grown in almost any type of soil. As long as it is well irrigated (whether through irrigation or rain water), it can grow in both wet or dry fields. However, we expect good yields in our field, so we have to prepare the soil so that it can accept small rice plants (transplanting method) or pre-sprouted and incubated seeds (method of sowing seeds directly).First of all, the rice seeds should be cleaned thoroughly so that any weeds and unwanted things can come out. Many farmers plow the fields to plow the soil. In addition, harrowing helps break up the clay pieces into smaller parts. Leveling of land with laser is also a very common activity among commercial rice growers.Keep in mind that every farm is different and has different needs. We suggest you seek advice from a local licensed specialist to make a rational plan to prepare the field.There are two major methods of soil preparation, wet preparation, and dry preparation.Wet preparationWet preparation is an option for hilly and lowland areas. In this method, in order to cultivate rice in future, the field needs to be prepared with lots of water. In this method, the soil is filled with water. We can keep the following steps in mind to prepare a rice field.Step 1: Build or repair the canal. In general, canals help prevent rainwater. We can construct 19 × 12 inch (50 × 30 cm) canals around the farm. Many rice farmers state that the height of each canal is 1,1–1,9 inches (3–5 cm). Its purpose is to ensure the availability of water at the time of rain.Step 2: Farm irrigation. After the construction of water canals, many rice farmers irrigate the field for at least a week. This makes the soil smooth, soft and ready for tillage.Step 3: tillage processes. After adequate irrigation of the soil, we can do plowing. When the soil is sufficiently wet, it is likely to be ready for plowing.Step 4: Filling the field with water. After plowing, rice farmers often water the field for 2 weeks.Step 5: Assisted tillage procedures. This step is done at least 10 days after filling the field with water. This includes flogging the field and running hanga. Soil can be whipped with rotavators and power tillers. The soil becomes like mud. By this method, in general, soil nutrient preservation and availability can be achieved. After this, we can run Hanga in the rice field 2-3 more times in an interval of 5-7 days.Step 6: Leveling the field. The last stage of wet preparation is two days before planting. Tractors or animals can help in this process. A wooden plank attached to them will float across the field and level it. The flat surface of the soil is also necessary for the proper growth of crops.Dry preparationDry preparation can be done for both lowland and hilly farms. This type of preparation requires less water. We can keep the following steps in mind for preparing rice field.Step 1: Building the canal. As mentioned above, canals help prevent rainwater. We can construct 19 × 12 inch (50 × 30 cm) canals around the farm. Typically, the height of each canal is 1,1–1,9 inches (3–5 cm). Its purpose is to ensure the availability of water at the time of rain.Step 2: Tillage Procedures. After adequate irrigation of the soil, we can do plowing.Step 3: Assisted tillage procedures. Farmers often run hanga from rototillers to the field and plow it.Step 4: Leveling the field. In dry preparations, we have less amount of water in the field. In this case, we do not normally have to use wooden planks to flatten it. Typically, land is leveled with a laser in it. For good growth of crops, it is necessary to level the soil surface.Step 5: Weed control. A common way to stop weeds growing is to allow them to grow for at least two weeks. After they grow, farmers often use weed pests (always consult a licensed agronomist before using any crop protection product). We should be very careful about any possible herbicide effects.Manures and chemical fertilizers: -Chemical fertilizer in rice farming N. Pk - 60:20:24 kg / acre should be used respectively. Also, organic manure can be used. Keep in mind that essential nutrients should be used only on the basis of soil testing. Diseases of Paddy: -The spread of diseases depends on temperature and other climatic factors and also the effect of crop activities. Major diseases of paddy are divided into three parts based on their factors:Fungal diseases - diseases caused by fungiBlastStem rotFoot rot & bakanaeSheath rotSheath blightBrown spotFalse smutUdbattaBacterial disease - diseases caused by bacteriaBacterial leaf blightBacterial leaf streakVirus - A disease caused by a virusटुंग्रो (Tungro)Grassy stuntweed control :-Khurpi or pediweeder can be used to destroy paddy. Also, pendimethyl in chemical weedicide can be used at the rate of 1-1.5 liters / ha 2-3 days after transplanting. "

      "crop": "MOONG (मूंग)",
      "details": "In India, moong is a major pulses crop of both summer and kharif season. Its grain is mainly used for lentils, which contain 24–26% protein, 55–60% kabrohydrate and 1.3% fat. Due to being a pulp crop, it is found in the roots that stabilize atmospheric nitrogen (38-40 kg nitrogen per hectare) and 1.5 tonnes of organic matter per hectare in the form of roots and leaves after harvest from the field. It is released into the soil, which maintains the organic carbon in the soil and increases the fertility of the soil.Seed rate and seed treatment: -In Kharif, moong is 20 kg / s for sowing by queue method. Is enough. 25-30 kg / s for spring or summer sowing. Seeds are required. Before sowing, treat the seeds with Carbendazim + Captan (1 + 2) @ 3 gm per kg of seed.Method of sowing: -In the rainy season, sowing in rows or rows behind the plow is appropriate to get good production from these crops. For kharif crop, the distance from the queue to the queue is 30-45 cm. And 20–22.5 cm for spring (summer). The distance from plant to plant is kept 10-15 cm. Keeping 4 cm Should be sown at a depth of.Climate suitable for cultivation of moong: -Moong requires moist and hot climate. It can be cultivated in Varsha Ritu. The temperature of 25-32 ° C has been found to be favorable for its growth and development. 75-90 cm for moong Areas with annual rainfall have been found suitable. There should be clean weather and 60% humidity at the time of ripening. More rainfall is harmful during ripening. The above mentioned land of cultivation of Mung: -For cultivation of mungs, the loam to sandy loam lands, whose Ph. 7.0 to 7.5 is best for this. The drainage in the field should be good. Land Preparation: -For the Kharif crop, a deep plowing should be done with a soil-plowing plow and after plowing with a native plow or cultivator 2-3 times after the rains begin, weeding out the weeds and leveling the field. Chlorpyriphos 1.5% powder 20-25 kg / ha should be added to the soil at the time of field preparation to prevent termites. For summer moong cultivation, plowing should be done immediately after rabi crops are harvested, leaving 4-5 days after plowing the field immediately. After Palewa, make 2-3 plowings with native plow or cultivator and make the field flat and brittle. It conserves moisture in it and gives good germination from seeds.Manures and Fertilizers: -For good production in mung cultivation, good rotten dung manure should be added to the soil at the rate of 15 - 20 tons / acre while preparing the field before sowing. The amount of chemical fertilizer and fertilizer is kg / ha. Should be nitrogen 20, phosphorus 20, potash 20, sulfur 20, zinc 20,The entire quantity of nitrogen, phosphorus and potash fertilizers is 5-10 cm at the time of sowing. Give as base manure in deep junk. Harmful Pests and Diseases and their PreventionPest Control: -In moong crops, there is mainly outbreak of legumes, green pudding, mahoo and blanket pest. For the control of leaf gluttonous insects, 1.5 liters of quinalphos or 750 ml of monocrotophos. And dimethylate 1000 ml for juice indicator pests like green fudka, mahoo and white fly. Per 600 liters of water or imidacloprid 17.8 s.l. 125 ml per 600 liters of water Spraying per hectare is beneficial according to the medicine.disease Control :-Most yellow disease, foliage and bhuthiya diseases are predominant in moong. To prevent these diseases, the anti-disease varieties HUM-1, Pant Moong-1, Pant Moong-2, TJM-3, JM-721 etc. should be used. For the control of yellow disease spread by white fly, Metacistox 25 EC 750 to 1000 ml. Of water and sprayed in 600 liters of water, sprayed twice per hectare at intervals of 15 days. For the control of fungal borne frost (Alternaria / Sarcospora / Myrotheaceous) diseases, make a mixed medicine of diethane m. 45, 2.5 g / liter or carbendazim, diethane m. 45 and dissolve in 2.0 g / liter of water, except in rainy days. Open season Sprinkle in Repeat spraying after 12-15 days as necessary.Major diseases and control of moong: -Yellow mole disease ( disease-resistant ) or tolerant varieties like TJM-3, K-851, Pant Moong-2, Pusa Vishal, H.U.M. Select -1. Use certified and healthy seeds. Sow the seeds in the queues till the first week of July, in the initial stage, destroy the diseased plants by uprooting them. The disease is virus-borne carrier of white fly insect which is used to control Triazophos 40 EC, 2 ml per liter or Thiomethoxam 25 WG. 2 g / l Or dimethate 30 EC, 1 ml / l. Prepare the solution in water and spray it 2 or 3 times at 10 days intervals as needed.Sarkospora leaf blot - Use healthy seeds without disease. Plants should not be dense in the field. 10 cm of plants. Dilute according to the distance of. Mencozeb 75 W when symptoms of the disease are seen. P. K 2.5 g liter or Carbendizim 50 W. 1 g / l of P. Make a medicine solution and spray it 2-3 times.Entrachnose - Select certified and healthy seeds. Fungicide drugs such as Mencozeb 75 W. P. 2.5 g / l Or 1 g / l of Carbendazim 50 WD. Spray 40 to 55 days after sowing.Charcoal Thawing - Seed Treatment Carbendazim 50 WG. Take 1 gram per kg of seed. Adopt a 2-3 year crop cycle and include jowar, millet crops in the crop cycle.Bhabhutiya (Pavdari mildew) disease - Select disease resistant varieties. Sow on time. Carathan or sulfur powder 2.5 g / l when symptoms of the disease are seen. Spray at the rate of water.weed control :-In the moong crop, not controlling the slack at the right time can reduce the yield of the crop by up to 40-60 percent. In kharif season crops include succulent leaf weeds such as: Sava (unitocloclova colacanum / Ku sageli), dug grass (Cyanodon dactylon) and broad leaf stone chatta (Trianthima monogyana), Kanakwa (Comelina veghalensis), Mahkua (Azeratum conizurgis), white. (Silosia argensia), Hazardana (Phyllanthus niruri) and garlic (Digera arsis), and weeds of Motha (Cyprus rotundus, Cyprus iria), etc. are abundant. In moong, the revolutionary stage of crop and weed competition lasts for the first 30 to 35 days. Therefore, the first sleep-kneading should be done on 15-20 days and the second on 35-40 days. Weed destroyer Pendimethylene 700 g / ha can be sprayed for 0-3 days after sowing, Cuzalofap 40-50 g after 15-20 days of sowing.Irrigation and drainage: -Generally, during the rainy season, the moong crop does not require irrigation, yet in this season, after a rainfall there is a long gap between the second rainfall or when there is a lack of moisture, a light irrigation is required when the legumes are formed. Irrigation is required at the interval of 10-15 days in spring and summer season. Irrigation should be stopped 15 days before harvesting. In the rainy season, excess water should be removed from the field when there is excess rain or if there is waterlogging in the field, due to which the air circulation in the soil remains.Harvesting: -When the moong beans turn black and dry, the crop should be harvested. There is a fear of chopping the beans on over-drying. The seeds are separated from the beans by threshers or by poles.Storage: -After harvesting and threshing, the grains are eligible for storage only when the moisture content is 8 to 10 percent after drying them in the sun properly. Use storage yarn sacks and keep them in a moisture-free place."

      "crop": "SESAME (तिल)",
      "details": "Sesame seed is an important oilseed crop. Apart from the Kharif season, it is also planted in the summer and semi-winter seasons. This crop can be successfully cultivated in Gujarat and especially in Saurashtra during the summer season. Important things to keep in mind summer sesame cultivation are as follows. This variety is very suitable according to the summer season and it takes about two and a half months to 3 months to get this variety ready, for harvesting sesame, the state, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan have a very favorable time.Advanced varieties of sesame: -Major improved varieties of sesame, eg T-4 T-12, T-13, T-78, Rajasthan Til-346, Madhavi, Shekhar, Kaniki White, Pragati, Pratap, Gujarat Til-3, Haryana Til, Tarun, Gujarat There are Til-4, Punjab Til-1, Brajeshwari (TLK-4) etc.Quantity of seed: - 4 to 5 kg of seed per acre is required.Seed treatment: - For prevention of seed borne root rot, seed should be treated with captan or theram fungicide at the rate of 2.5 g / kg seed. Or treat 4 grams of Trichoderma viridis per kg of seed.Time of sowing :-Sow sesame seeds at the appropriate time, sow in the first week of July after the first monsoon rains. The delay in sowing leads to a decrease in crop production. If the temperature is 25 to 27 degree centigrade at the time of sowing, it is good for germination. The sowing time in the month of March is the best time for the Zayed season.Method of sowing: - The method of sowing has a direct effect on the yield of sesame. Sesame seed should be sown in straight lines. 30 to 45 distance from line to line and 10 to 15 distance from plant to plant. M Should be kept. Sesame seed is small in size, so it should not be sown deep.Earth :-Matiyar sandy lands are suitable for sesame cultivation.The pH value of soil is 5.5 to 8.0, acidic or alkaline soils are not suitable for sesame.Climate :-Medium temperature is required for sesame, the temperature in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan is best for this crop.Preparation of field: -After taking the last crop, the soil should be potted and made brittle. Before plowing the monsoon, the field should be plowed and leveled, and one or two plowing should prepare the field.Manures and chemical fertilizers: - Prior to sowing of sesame, good rotten dung manure should be mixed well in the soil of 10-15 tons / acre while preparing the field. And 60 kg in chemical fertilizer. Nitrogen, 46 kg Phosphorus, and 15 kg Sulfur should be given per hectare. The entire quantity of phosphorus and half of nitrogen and sulfur should be put in the field at the time of sowing. And the remaining half of nitrogen and sulfur should be given as a spraying in the standing crop when the crop is 30-35 days old.Harmful Pests and Diseases and their PreventionHarmful pests: -Cheek fly - Monocrotophos 36 W for its prevention. P. or Qinalfas 25 E.C. Spraying should be done at the rate of one liter / ha. Pod and leaf borer - Monocrotophos 36 W for its prevention. Sprinkle 50% soluble powder of P. or Carbaryl on the crop.Harmful diseases: -Root and stem rotting - To prevent this, seeds should be treated and sown before sowing the seeds. Sesame crop should not be taken continuously in the field affected by this disease.Scorching and Angamor - To prevent this, spraying of Mancozeb or Zineb one and a half kilograms or captan at the rate of two to two and a half kilograms per hectare. Repeat the spraying after 15 days.Bhubhtiya disease - To prevent this, powder sulfur is crushed. And mancozeb 40 g or mycobutanil 10% w. P., sprayed with 10 grams / 15 liters of water.weed control :-Keeping the sesame crop free from weeds for the first 45 days helps in plant growth and development. Immediately after sowing sesame seeds, spray Alcolor 1.5 L / ha (60 ml in 10 liters of water) on the ground. Weeding and kneading the hands as required. If there is lack of labor, then spraying of quilizophope ethyl at the rate of 0.05 kg per hectare in standing crop 3 days after sowing.Irrigation: - The crop is rainfed during the Kharif season. Therefore, according to the state of rainfall, moisture level in the land, type of land and crop demand, irrigation is required to maintain adequate moisture in the land. The appearance of fading, drying and flowering of the leaves during the early morning hours in the fields shows the need for irrigation in the crop. The critical stages of irrigation for good yield are before or after sowing, the stage of flowering and the stage of flowering, so must irrigate at these three stages.Harvesting: -Sesame crop which will be ready in two and a half months. Most of the crops do not cook together, but most of the pods should be harvested when they turn brownish yellow in color. The bundles of the crop should be made and kept. After drying, the pimples are cracked and then they are turned upside down and beaten with the baton and the grains are separated. After drying the seeds should be stored after remaining 9 percent moisture.Yield :-Its production is around 5 to 6 quintals per acre, which is very good and this variety which is ready to ripen in a very short time, in 3 months, this crop can be planted by the farmers and brought back home to be harvested.

      "crop": "GUAR (ग्वार)",
      "details": "Guar scientific name (cluster bean) 'Saya Motiss Tetrogonolobs' (Cyamopsis tetragonolobus). It is also known as Chatarfali in Madhya Pradesh (India). Is also mostly used as animal feed. Feeding guar to animals gives them strength and increases the ability of milking animals to give milk. Gum is also manufactured from guar. This 'guar gum' is used in many products. Delicious tarkari is made from guar pods. Guar also has a special contribution in pulses. This crop is taken in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh etc. The state of Rajasthan is the leader in terms of area and production of guar in India.Crop Variety: -Durgajay, Durgapura Safed, Guar Kranti (RGC-1031)Quantity of seed: -For seed production - 12 to 15 kg per hectare.Sowing Time: -It is cultivated for the purpose of fodder as well as grain, complete the sowing from mid-July to mid-August.Seed treatment: -The seeds are immersed in hot water at 58 ° C for 10 minutes and then dried at room temperature before sowing. It kills all fungi mycelium and inactivates their spores to spread disease in the crop. After this, treat seeds per kg of seeds with 3 grams of thiram. And it is beneficial to treat seedlings with Rhizobium culture.Method of sowing: -DistanceRow to row - 45 cm (normal) and 30 cm (late sowing)Plant to plant - 15-20 cmDepth: -Seeds should be 2-3 cm long. Sow at the depth ofPeriod of harvest: -The growing season ranges from 60–90 days (determining varieties) to 120–150 days (indeterminate varieties).Earth :-Guar crop can be taken in almost all types of land, but it is not suitable for alkaline and land where water is inhabited. Gives the best results when grown on well-drained sandy loam soils. This crop can be grown successfully in irrigated, non-irrigated and very low rainfall areas. Guar cultivation can be done easily on mild alkaline and saline soils with pH value of 7.5 to 8.5.Land  Preparation: -In the month of May, the field should be left with one or two deep plowing. With the first monsoon rains, the field should be prepared by planting one or two plots. After the final plowing, apply the pata so that the soil moisture is preserved. Thus weeds flourish less in prepared fields. Also, there is excess accumulation of rain water.Favorable Climate: -Sowing temperature28-30 degrees.Harvesting temperature30-35 degrees.Manures and chemical fertilizers: -Compost manure or fine rotten cow dung should be mixed well in the soil at the rate of 20 - 25 t / ha while preparing the field before sowing guar. As a pulses crop, guar crops generally require less fertilizer. For better production of guar, 20-25 kg of nitrogen, 40-50 kg of phosphorus, 20 kg of sulfur have been recommended by scientists. Keep in mind that essential nutrients should be given on the basis of soil testing.Harmful Pests and Diseases and PreventionHarmful pests: -Juice suckers - jacid, aphid, white fly etc.To prevent this, spray the dimethoate 30 EC, 1.7 ml per liter of water or imidachloroprid, 0.2 ml per liter of water and make a second spraying after 10 to 12 days.Termites- To prevent this, chlorpyrifas or phorate 10g or qinalfas should be mixed well in pre-sown soil at the rate of 1.5 percent full 25 kg per hectare.Harmful diseases: -Root rot - To prevent this, seeds should be treated before sowing. Anthracnose and Alternaria Leaf Spot - For the prevention of this disease, 2 kg of dietary M-45 (0.2%) is added in one thousand liters of water at a 15-day interval. Spraying should be done according to the active ingredient / ha.Bacterial blight - To prevent this, spray the solution of copper oxychloride in 2.5 grams per liter of water.weed control :-During the initial growth of the crop, keep the field clean by weeding and weeding. For the prevention of weeds by chemical means, pandimethalin 750 ml Mixing with 200 liters of water, spray it per acre within 24 hours of sowing.Irrigation: -Generally, crops sown in July do not require irrigation. But in the event of no rain, an irrigation must be done while making beans.Harvesting: - It is harvested in late October and early November. The crop sown to be used as fodder should be harvested at the time of flowering. As a green manure, cultivate the tenant crop at the same time as the legumes are planted. Legumes, according to the variety of guar, begin to fall after 60-90 days from sowing. Green beans should be harvested at a distance of 10 to 12 days. The tenanted crop should be harvested after the legumes are ripened to prepare the seeds. The crop prepared by ripening should be cut with the help of a scythe and left to dry in the sun for a few days. After this, the grains should be separated with the help of a cavity or thrasher.production capability :-The average yield of guar seed in India is about 10 to 17 quintals / ha. For fodder, crop should be harvested at the time of flowering or in the initial stage of producing pods (50 to 85 days after sowing). Guar crops yield 250 to 300 quintals of green fodder per hectare. In this way, by adopting advanced farming techniques, maximum profit can be made from the guar crop."

Sunflower oil is most popular due to its light color, blend flavor, high smoke point and high level of linoleic acid which is good for the heart patient. Sunflower seeds contain about 48– 53 percent edible oil. It has been grown in India after the 1969-70 shortage of edible oil. Sunflower has a special place in oilseed crops. It is also a special oilseed crop in our country after peanuts, mustard, rapeseed and soyabean.Many varieties of sunflowers are found.Sunflower is mainly divided into two species.1. Package species- Surya, Volcano, Mardan, MSFH4.  2. Hybrid species - K.V. SH 1, SH-3322, F S H-17, Kaveri 618.Time of sowingSowing of this crop is done from 15-25 July in Kharif season, 20 October to 10 November in Rabi season and Zayed crop from 20 February to 10 March.Seed quantityFor seedling of sunflower, use a seed rate of 2-3 kg / acre. Seed rate 2–2.5 kg / acre for hybrid use.Seed treatmentFor quick germination, before sowing, soak the seeds in water for 24 hours and dry in the shade. Then treat the seeds at the rate of 2 grams per kg of thyram seed. This will protect the seeds from soil borne pests and diseases. To protect the crop from marsh mold, treat the seeds with 6 gm per kg of metal. Treat the seeds with imidacloprid 5-6 ml per kg of seed.Distance60 cm in two rows And 30 cm between two plants. Keep a distance ofSeed depthSeeds should be 4-5 cm long. Sow at the depth of Sowing patternThe sowing is done by digging the pit. Apart from this, seeds are made by sowing machine by making beds or bunds.Land selection - Sunflower crops are grown in different types of lands.- Balui land is more suitable for this crop.- The pH value of the land should be between 6-5 to 8.Acidic lands are not suitable for sunflower cultivation. This crop tolerates mild alkalinity.Field preparation- For the preparation of the field, a deep plowing is done with a soil-plow plow.- Grass, chaff and stalks etc. present in the field should be collected and burnt.- Harrow should be run 2-3 times to make the soil of the field brittle.After every plowing or harrow, patting is necessary for moisture conservation in the soil.Amount of manure and fertilizerFor sunflower crop, one month before sowing, 10 tons of rotten cow dung manure should be applied per hectare. 80 kg for the cultivation of the progressive castes. Nitrogen, 60 kg Phosphorus and 40 kg potash per hectare should be used.For hybrids, 150 kg nitrogen, 80 kg phosphorus and 70 kg potash per hectare should be used. Two thirds of the total quantity, nitrogen and total phosphorus and potash should be used at the time of sowing.The remaining amount of nitrogen should be used after 45 days. For crop growth, spray 5 gm / liter of water of 19:19:19 on 5-6 leaves and twice at 8 days spacing. At the time of blooming flowers, take 2 grams per gram. Spray Boron. Keep in mind that chemical fertilizers should be used on the basis of soil testing only.Harmful Pests and PreventionTobacco Sundry:   It is the main worm of sunflower and attacks in April-May. They make leaves their food. Destroy the eggs with leaves. If its attack is seen then Fipronil SC 2 ml. Spray per liter of water. In the event of increased attack, use two sprays at a distance of 10 days or spinosad 5 ml. Per 10 l. Water or Nuwan + Indoxacarb 1 ml Spray in water per liter of water.American Sundry: This worm eats plants and grains. This causes fungus and flowers to melt. Its trunk is green to brown in color. To prevent this, apply 4 pheromone cards per acre. If the danger is increased then spray Carbaryl 1 kg or 800 grams of Acetate or 1 gram of Kalporifoss in 100 liters of water and spray it per acre.Hairy Sundi: Sundi eats leaves from the underside, which dries the plant. Its hair is yellow and hair is black. Collect and destroy the trunk. If seen, fipronil SC 2 ml. Spray in water per liter of water. If the attack is severe, spray 2 sprays at an interval of 10 days or spinosad is 5 ml. Spray in 10 liters of water.Teela: Its attack occurs at the time of forming eyes. This leaves the leaves twisted and looks burnt. If over 10-20 percent of the boots see an attack of insects sucking the juice, then spray neem seed Karnal Extrac with 50gm per liter of water.Diseases and preventionKungi: This disease causes yield loss up to 20 percent. If a kungi attack is seen, spray Tridamorph 1 gram or Mancozeb 2 gram per liter of water to prevent it. Spray a second time or hexaconazole 2 ml at an interval of 15 days. Spray in two liters of water at an interval of 10 days.Degradation of roots: Plants with this disease become weak and ripen quickly. On the stem there are spots of ash colored, after pollination, the plant suddenly dries up. To prevent this, after 30 days of sowing, add 1 kg of Taraikoderma viraid in 20 kg of manure or sand. In addition, spray Carbendazim with 1 gram per liter of water.Melt of the stem: This disease causes damage after 40 days of planting the crop. The stem of the affected plant and near the ground starts to develop mold. To control this, treat seeds with 2 grams of thiram per kg before sowing.Alternaria Scorching Disease: Seed and oil yields are reduced due to this disease. First, dark brown and black spots appear on the lower leaves, which later reach the top leaves. These spots also reach above the stem when damage increases. If you see any damage, then mix Mancozeb 3 grams per liter of water and spray it four times at an interval of 10 days. Flowering of flowers: Initially, brown spots appear on the flowers. Later these spots grow and become moldy, which eventually turn black. If you see any damage at the time of flowering or formation, spray Mancozeb 2 grams per liter of water.weed controlWeeds like Motha, Bathua, Krishnil and Hirankhuri are found in sunflower crops grown during the Rabi season.- 2 to 3 weeding is necessary for weed control in sunflower. The first hoeing should be done 20 days after planting. After that, after 15 to 20 days, we should do the hoeing again. And at the same time, the roots of the plants should be planted. Pendimethalin 30 EC for chemically weed control Sprinkling of the appropriate amount should be done in the field before sowing or after two days of sowing.Irrigation- Irrigation is not required for sunflower crop grown in Kharif season.- If there is a lack of rainfall, then one irrigation of the crop can be done in this season.- Generally 3-4 irrigations are required for the crop grown during the Rabi season. These irrigations should be done after 40, 60 and 90 days of sowing.- Zaid season requires more water for the crop. Total 6 to 7 seats have to be given. - One irrigation is required every fortnight.To get good yield of this crop, there should be no shortage of water at the time of flowering of crop plants in the land, when buds are formed and while grains are being filled.HarvestingHarvest when the sunflower leaves dry and the flowers turn yellow. Do not delay the harvesting as this leaves the leaves fall and increases the risk of termites. Dry the flowers for 2-3 days after breaking. The seeds are easily removed from the dried flowers. Threshing can be done with the machine.StorageAfter sowing, seeds should be dried before storage and the water content should be 9-10 percent. The species of sunflower has a special effect on its species, the season to be grown and irrigation etc. The yield of sunflower crop grown during Rabi season is 10-20 q / ha."

      "crop": "JUTE (जूट)",
      "details": "Jute is a dicot, fibrous plant. Its stem is thin and cylindrical. There are fibers of jute, jute and similar plants. Its fibers are used for making sacks, carpets, tents, tarpaulins, sacks, ropes, low-grade cloth and paper.The word 'jute' is thought to derive from 'jata' or 'jute' in Sanskrit. In Europe, the term was first used in the 18th century, although the import of this substance had been in the name of \"PAT\" since before the 18th century.Jute is one of the important natural fibers in terms of cotton cultivation and use. Farming is dependent on climate, weather and soil. About 85% of the world's jute farming is concentrated in the Ganges delta. This fertile geographical area is shared by Bangladesh and India (mainly West Bengal). China also dominates in jute cultivation. On a smaller scale, Thailand, Myanmar (Burma), Pakistan, Nepal and Bhutan also cultivate jute.Popular varietiesThere are two major varieties of jute, each variety is as follows,Capsularis - JRC 321, JRC 212, UPC 94 (Reshma), JRC 698, Ankit (NDC - 2008), NDC 9102Olitorius- JRO632 , JRO878 , JRO7835 , JRO524 (Naveen), JRO66Time of sowingJute is sown in February on sloping land and in high altitude land from March to July. Seed quantitySowing in rows from seed drill is sufficient for 4 to 5 kg of seeds of Capsularis and 3 to 5 kg of seeds per hectare for olitarius. 5 to 6 kg of seed is required when sowing sprinkles.Seed treatmentBefore sowing, the seeds of jute should be sown by treating them at the rate of 3 grams of Thiram or Carbendazim 50 wp 2 grams per kg of seeds.Method of sowingSowing of jute should be done behind the plow, the distance from the lines to the lines should be 30 centimeters and the distance from plant to plant should not be more than 7 to 8 centimeters and depth should not be more than 2 to 3 centimeters. Sowing of 4 lines is done using multiro jute seed drill and one person can sow one acre in a day.Suitable landLight sandy and loam soils are suitable for jute cultivation. It is not advisable to cultivate it in high waterlogged land. Because being full of water for a long time, there is a risk of loss of the plant and loss of quality. PH of land for its cultivation The value must be normal. Favorable climateHot and humid climate is suitable for jute cultivation. Its plants need rain. But unusual rainfall damages its yield. It is grown in summer and rainy seasons. Due to this, the effect of winter is not seen on its crop.Field preparationA plowing is done with a soil-plowing plow and later 2 to 3 plows with a native plow or cultivator, potted and the land is crushed and the field is prepared for sowing. Since jute seed is very small, it is necessary for the soil to be brittle, so that the deposition of jute seeds is good. Appropriate moisture in the soil is considered good for deposition.Manures and FertilizersTo get more yield from jute cultivation, it is necessary to give proper amount of fertilizer in its cultivation. For this, at the time of plowing the field, put 25 to 30 tons of rotten old dung manure in the field and mix it well in the soil. In addition to organic manure, if the farmer wants to use chemical fertilizer in his fields, for this, at the time of last plowing, in the ratio of 2: 1: 1 in the ratio of 2: 1: 1, 90 kg of nitrogen, phosphorus and potash per hectare is applied in the field. Add it to the soil. After that, apply half the amount of nitrogen with irrigation to the plants twice.Kits and diseases and their preventionJute crop is usually affected by two diseases - root and stem rot and sometimes these crops are completely destroyed by these diseases. To avoid this, seeds should be sown after reseeding. To prevent these diseases, Trichoderma viridi should be used at the rate of 5 grams per kg of seed and 2.5 kg per hectare of 50 kg of cow dung mixed with rotten manure.Jute crops are prone to outbreak of semilooper, apian, stem bevil pests. To prevent these pests, 1.5 liters of dicafal can be dissolved in 700 to 800 liters of water and sprayed at 40 to 45 and 60 to 65 and 100 to 105 days of the crop. To control these pests, Neem-produced chemical Azadirectin should be sprayed at a rate of 1.5 liters of 0.03%."
